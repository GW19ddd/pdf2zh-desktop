## ✨ Desktop Enhancements

### 🎯 True Zero-Barrier Experience

- 📦 **Fully self-contained**: Python 3.12 runtime + all dependencies bundled — zero system pollution
- 🖱️ **No more command line**: Drag & drop your PDFs, click translate
- 🔧 **Smart error diagnostics**: Something wrong? The app pops up a dialog telling you how to fix it
- 💼 **Truly portable**: Copy to a USB drive, run on any Windows PC

### 🚀 Massive Documents? No Problem!

- 📄 1000+ page documents handled with ease
- 🧩 **Chunk translation**: Customize chunk size (5–200 pages), auto-splits large PDFs, built-in rate-limit delays, assembles the complete document when done
- 🧠 **Smart memory management**: Per-page layout array release prevents OOM even on 1000+ page books
- ⏯️ Auto-resume — quit mid-translation and pick up right where you left off, no wasted API calls
- 📜 **Scanned PDF support**: Generates white backgrounds over translated regions to cover the original text in the page image, so scanned books get clean, readable translations
- 📊 **Table/figure translation**: Enable to translate text inside tables and figure captions — ideal for patent documents
- 🔍 **Built-in OCR**: Powered by RapidOCR — automatically recognizes and translates pure-image scanned PDFs (no text layer)

### 🤖 AI Translation Config

- 🧩 **20+ model presets**: DeepSeek, Zhipu GLM, Qwen, Kimi, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Ollama and more — one click to configure
- 🔧 **Fully customizable**: Supports any OpenAI-compatible API — enter your own URL, key and model
- 🔗 **One-click connection test**: Verify your config works instantly, auto-saves on success

### 📚 History & Live Preview

- 🗂️ Full translation history, navigate with keyboard arrow keys
- 👀 Built-in PDF previewer — what you see is what you get
- 🔍 Before/after comparison at a glance
- 📝 Re-translating the same file auto-numbers output (`file(1)`, `file(2)`), never overwrites previous results

### 📁 Batch Translation

- 📂 Drop in a whole folder of PDFs — each file translated and tracked individually
- 🎯 Smart file detection — only processes PDF files

---

## 🚀 Three Steps to Get Started

1. 📥 **[Download the latest Release](https://github.com/GW19ddd/pdf2zh-desktop/releases/latest)** (zip file, ready to use)
2. 🖱️ **Double-click `pdf2zh.bat`** to launch
3. 📄 **Drop in a PDF** → pick a translation service → hit "Start Translation" → done! 🎉

> 💡 **Tip**: Google / Bing translation is free and requires zero configuration — just open and go!
>
> ⚠️ Download the zip from the [Releases page](https://github.com/GW19ddd/pdf2zh-desktop/releases/latest). Do **NOT** click "Source code" — it won't work out of the box.

## 🔗 Zotero Integration

Translate PDFs directly from Zotero — the translated PDF is automatically added back to the item:

- **One-click plugin install**: Settings → Zotero → "Install Zotero plugin" (Windows / macOS), then restart Zotero
- **Right-click translate**: right-click a PDF attachment in the item tree or inside the PDF reader → "📖 用 pdf2zh-desktop 翻译" (Translate with pdf2zh-desktop)
- **Formats**: side-by-side / dual / mono / all three — selectable right from the context menu
- **Linked attachments**: if the original PDF lives outside Zotero storage (moved by zotmoov / attanger), the translation is placed next to it and linked back to the item (plugin v1.0.30+)
- **Plugin settings panel**: Zotero → Settings → pdf2zh 翻译 — default format, silent translation, auto-locate item, app path
- **Silent mode**: translate in the background without stealing focus; the window closes itself when done

> The plugin only needs to be installed once. Users without Zotero are completely unaffected.
> Compatible with Zotero 7 / 8 / 9; auto-updates via updates.json.

## 🌍 20+ Translation Services — Pick Your Favorite

| Type | Services |
| --- | --- |
| 🆓 Free | Google Translate, Bing Translate |
| 🔑 API Key Required | OpenAI, DeepL, DeepLX, DeepSeek, Gemini, Azure |
| 🇨🇳 China-based | Zhipu GLM, Silicon Flow, Tencent, Ali Qwen-MT |
| 🏠 Self-hosted | Ollama, Xinference, Argos Translate (fully offline) |
| 🔧 Other | Dify, AnythingLLM, Grok, Groq |

---

## 📄 Three Output Formats

Every translation generates:

- 📝 **`filename-mono.pdf`** — Translation only, clean and crisp
- 📖 **`filename-dual.pdf`** — Bilingual version, original and translation alternating
- ↔️ **Side-by-side** — Original on the left, translation on the right

---

## 🤖 AI-Powered Layout Detection

Built-in DocLayout-YOLO model identifies page regions (body text, formulas, captions, headings, etc.) and ensures translated content is placed in exactly the right spot.

- ✅ Status indicator: "AI Layout Detection Enabled ✓" shown at translation start
- 📋 Full translation logs at `logs/translate.log` for easy debugging

> ⚠️ Requires [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) (`VC_redist.x64.exe` included in the folder).
> Without it, translation works perfectly — layout detection accuracy is just slightly reduced.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| 😰 What happened? | 💡 How to fix |
| --- | --- |
| VBS says "incompatible" | Windows 11 24H2 deprecated VBScript — use `pdf2zh.bat` instead |
| Double-clicked, nothing happened | Check `logs/startup_*.log` |
| Translation stopped midway | Check disk space; restart to auto-resume from cache |
| VC++ error | Run `install.bat` or manually install `VC_redist.x64.exe` |
| Garbled text / layout issues | Try enabling "Skip font subsetting" |
| AI layout detection status? | Check progress bar message; details in `logs/translate.log` |
| Out of memory on large docs? | Enable "Chunk Translation" and set an appropriate chunk size |
| Scanned book text overlaps translation? | Enable "Scanned PDF" in advanced options — it draws white backgrounds over translated regions |
| PDF finishes instantly with no translation? | Enable "OCR Recognition" in advanced options to auto-detect text in images |
| Patent tables not being translated? | Enable "Translate Tables and Figure Captions" in advanced options |
| Need full diagnostics? | Double-click `diagnostic.bat` for a report 📋 |
